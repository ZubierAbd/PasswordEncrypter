# PasswordEncrypter

So this is me attempting a small project for server side rendering. I am building a simple password encrypter and decrypter using the internal cryto module of NodeJs. 

I am also creating a server side rendered front end using HandleBarsJS(Templating language), Bootstrap as well as Material Icons. 

To run the file, please run the following command  

_node index.js_ 

Thanks
